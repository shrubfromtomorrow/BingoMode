ICED would like to thank:

All the Return of the Slug bingo event participants and volunteers for putting up with a changing tournament format and mod development.<LINE>Your participation and hard work helped the mod become what it is now, I greatly enjoy running these events and refining them for the future.

Nacu for putting up with me asking for updates for a whole year, and still going beyond what I expected from the mod in terms of features and polish. 

Bunnyface for taking care of the Youtube and major announcements, I wouldn't have been able to get as many people interested in bingo or speedrunning without him.

Everyone who was able to watch any of the event bingo matches live on Twitch or after on Youtube,<LINE>seeing more and more people be interested in bingo and in Rain World speedrunning is what this is all about!

The Fastest Furs event organizers, the bingo specific bingo mods for Hollow Knight,<LINE>Elden Ring, and Ori and the Blind Forest bingo and the Bingo panel at AGDQ 2025 as much of<LINE>what I modeled for the bingo mod and bingo events are based from these sources.

All of the talented artists who helped with this endeavor, Saren who has made an incredible<LINE>art piece for our past few events and WILD who has made our backdrops for almost every event I have run in particular.

The Rain World Speedrunning Community for being as interested as I am with<LINE>the bingo events and helping me run and host them. Rain World Bingo wouldn't exist without them.

My Twitch chat, my community, and everyone who has been interested in my progress and work in<LINE>Rain World seeing all the people support me over the years I wouldn't have been able to meet my goals of<LINE>running community events and improving Rain World in my own way without them.
