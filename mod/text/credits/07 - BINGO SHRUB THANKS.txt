shrub would like to thank:

Every member of the community who has played this mod and provided the feedback necessary to better the mod.

Sigma and TacticalFerret for thugging it out in many a VC through my long rants and desperate bargains when wrangling this game<LINE>Beyond that these two have always helped me without question, I'm eternally grateful.

ICED for hard carrying this community for years and laying the groundwork for those who come after to succeed.

Every artist who participated in the Watcher region art, it's been phenomenal to see their works come together.

The Rain World Speedrunning and Events community for perpetually granting me the opportunities to serve and support.<LINE>The ability to provide resources, guides, and assistance is an honor and has been fantastic for me personally.

My own community that has somehow been fostered; interest in my work and investment in it has been a core motivator for me.

And finally to all those who have made mods before me, especially Nacu, only on the shoulders of giants have any of us seen farther.
